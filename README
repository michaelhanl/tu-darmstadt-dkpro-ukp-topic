 --- TU DARMSTADT TOPIC - COMMENT DISCOURSE STRUCTURE ANNOTATOR FOR GERMAN


This project represents the intent to deploy discourse structure annotations and interpretations to the German language.
The project entails both the empirical study representation in form of xml rule files, as developed in (cf. reference to masters), 
as well as the structural markup annotators, based on the Stanford Parser (cf. stanford parser).
The main interpretation coding of this project is based on the works of R. Eckard de Castelho (with denominal and structural adaptations and bug fixes)



-- Compiling and Building Source Code-- 
The source code provides compile and package scripts to facilitate the useage of the application.
In order to create a runnable jar with the application, check that maven and ant are installed on your local system and that internet access is available, in case maven dependencies need resolving. 
During first compilation it is advised to set "maven.settings.offline" in the build properties to false to allow maven dependency resolution. 
To compile the code run "ant" or "ant build.modules" in the main directory. To create a runnable jar run "ant build:artifact". 
The script places the runnable jar in the artifact directory. 


-- Prerequisities --
To run smoothly the application assumes the presence of the following files and directory structure accordingly:
	- config/log4j.properties
	- config/config.properties
	- config/Rules_[Language-Code].xml
	- config/schema.xsd

Input and Output files can be provided as command line paramters.

-- Application Arguments --
The Advanced TreeruleEngine takes one of the following specifiers as first argument, according the requirements of the user:
	- all
	- parser
	- topic
	- learn
"all" parses the input document and returns a XML document as output with the respective matched rule instances as @rule attribute.
