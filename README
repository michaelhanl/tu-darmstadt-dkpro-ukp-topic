 --- TU DARMSTADT TOPIC - COMMENT DISCOURSE STRUCTURE ANNOTATOR FOR GERMAN


This project represents the intent to deploy discourse structure annotations and interpretations to the German language.
The project entails both the empirical study representation in form of xml rule files, as developed in (cf. reference to masters), 
as well as the structural markup annotators, based on the Stanford Parser (cf. stanford parser).
The main interpretation coding of this project is based on the works of R. Eckard de Castelho (with denominal and structural adaptations and bug fixes)
